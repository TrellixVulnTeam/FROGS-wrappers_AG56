.. class:: infomark page-header h2

What it does

Add taxonomic affiliation in abundance file.


.. class:: infomark page-header h2

Inputs/outputs

.. class:: h3

Inputs

**Sequence file**:

The sequences (format `FASTA &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format&gt;`_).

**Abundance file**:
 
The abundance of each OTU in each sample (format `BIOM &lt;http://biom-format.org/&gt;`_).

.. class:: h3

Outputs

**Abundance file** (tax_affiliation.biom):

 The abundance file with affiliation (format `BIOM &lt;http://biom-format.org/&gt;`_).

**Summary file** (report.html):

 This file presents the number of sequences affiliated by blast, and the number of multi-affiliation (format `HTML &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&gt;`_).

Reference database

All the databases we format (on demand) for RDPClassifier and NCBI Blast+ are inventoried here: http://genoweb.toulouse.inra.fr/frogs_databanks/assignation/readme.txt

.. class:: infomark page-header h2

How it works

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "Steps", "Description"
   :widths: 5, 150
   :class: table table-striped

   "1", "`RDPClassifier &lt;https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/tutorials/classifier/RDPtutorial_RDP_classifier.html&gt;`_ may be used with database to associate to each OTU a taxonomy and a bootstrap (example: *Bacteria;(1.0);Firmicutes;(1.0);Clostridia;(1.0);Clostridiales;(1.0);Clostridiaceae 1;(1.0);Clostridium sensu stricto;(1.0);*)."
   "2", "`blastn+ &lt;http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&gt;`_ or `needlall &lt;http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.6/emboss/apps/needleall.html&gt;`_ is used to find alignment between each OTU and the database. Only the bests hits with the same score are reported. blastn+ is used for merged read pair, and needall is used for artificially combined sequence. For each alignment returned, several metrics are computed: identity percentage, coverage percentage, and alignment length"
   "3", "For each OTU with several blastn+/needlall alignment results a consensus is determined on each taxonomic level. If all the taxa in a taxonomic rank are identical the taxon name is reported otherwise *Multi-affiliation* is reported. By example, if you have an OTU with two corresponding sequences, the first is a *Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Gamma Proteobacteria;Enterobacteriales*, the second is a *Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Beta Proteobacteria;Methylophilales*, the consensus will be *Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Multi-affiliation;Multi-affiliation*."

.. class:: infomark page-header h2

Alignment metrics details on identity percentage calculation

With classicala %id computation method, we will obtain for overlapped amplicon sequence and for artificially combined amplicon sequence :

* **Case 1: a sequencing of overlapping sequences i.e. 16S V3-V4 amplicon MiSeq sequencing**

.. image:: ${static_path}/images/tools/frogs/FROGS_affiliation_overlapped_percent_id.png
    :height: 325
    :width: 807

* **Case 2 : a sequencing of non-overlapping sequences: case of ITS1 amplicon MiSeq sequencing**

.. image:: ${static_path}/images/tools/frogs/FROGS_affiliation_combined_percent_id.png
    :height: 310
    :width: 887

* **Finally, how percentage identity is computed ?**

With the classical method of %id calculation, filtering on %id will systematically removed “FROGS combined” OTUs. So, we proposed to replace the classical %id by a %id computed on the sequenced bases only.

.. image:: ${static_path}/images/tools/frogs/FROGS_affiliation_percent_id_formula.png
    :height: 36
    :width: 637

For the precedent use cases we will obtain:

* Case 1: 16S V3V4 overlapped sequence
	% sequenced bases identity = 400 matches / 400 bp = 100%

* Case 2: very large ITS1 “FROGS combined” shorter than the real sequence
	% sequenced bases identity = (250 + 250 ) / (600 - 100) = 100%

This calculation allows to return 100% of identity on sequenced bases for “FROGS combined” shorter or longer than reality in case of perfect sequencing, and a smaller percentage of identity in the case of small overlap repeat kept in FROGS combined sequence.

Advices

This tool can take large time. It is recommended to filter your abundance and your sequence file before this tool (see **FROGS Filters**).

As you can see the affiliation of each OTU is not human readable in outputed abundance file. We provide a tools to convert these BIOM file in tabulated file, see the **FROGS BIOM to TSV** tool.
